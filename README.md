# Whitepaper - Taba Project
Strengthening the bonds within your community through blockchain

Introduction
Taba is a blockchain-based platform designed to strengthen the social and economic ties within your community, neighborhood, or district. The project allows citizens to directly invest in local initiatives, fostering improvements and making the place where they live more self-sustainable. Through a decentralized system, community members can support personal and collective projects in a secure and transparent way, tracking the entire process from investment to completion.

# Running the sample

## Running with the Dart SDK

You can run the example with the [Dart SDK](https://dart.dev/get-dart)
like this:

```
$ dart run bin/server.dart
Server listening on port 8080
```

And then from a second terminal:
```
$ curl http://0.0.0.0:8080
Hello, World!
$ curl http://0.0.0.0:8080/echo/I_love_Dart

## Running with Docker

If you have [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/get-started) installed, you
can build and run with the `docker` command:

```
$ docker build . -t myserver
$ docker run -it -p 8080:8080 myserver
Server listening on port 8080
```

And then from a second terminal:
```
$ curl http://0.0.0.0:8080
